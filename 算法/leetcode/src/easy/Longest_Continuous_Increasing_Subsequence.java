/*Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest continuous increasing subsequence.

        Example 1:
        Input: [1,3,5,4,7]
        Output: 3
        Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [1,3,5], its length is 3.
        Even though [1,3,5,7] is also an increasing subsequence, it's not a continuous one where 5 and 7 are separated by 4.
        Example 2:
        Input: [2,2,2,2,2]
        Output: 1
        Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [2], its length is 1.
        Note: Length of the array will not exceed 10,000.*/
